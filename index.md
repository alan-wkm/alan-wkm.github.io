# Alan Wong's Projects

Welcome! Here are some of my main projects in deep learning and data analysis.

## [Unsupervised Action Segmentation and Scene Understanding in Diverse Instructional Videos](https://github.com/alan-wkm/NTUFYP2025)

Efficiently navigating long instructional videos is challenging. This project introduces an **unsupervised approach** for segmenting actions and understanding scenes, leveraging both audio and visual cues.

- **Key Features:**

  - Automatic segmentation of instructional videos into meaningful chapters-no manual annotation required
  - Multimodal analysis using visual scene changes and audio transcriptions
  - Integration with Google Gemini API for enhanced segmentation
  - Flask web application for easy video uploads and structured, chapter-based insights
  - Outputs structured JSON with titles, timestamps, descriptions, and transcriptions

- **Results:**
  Achieved ~90% accuracy in action segmentation, improving navigation efficiency in instructional content.

- **Tech Stack:**
  Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, PySceneDetect, Faster Whisper, Flask, Google Gemini API

## [SC4001 NNDL 2025 - Individual Assignment](https://github.com/alan-wkm/SC4001_NNDL_2025_IndivAsg)

This assignment comprises two deep learning components:

- **Music Genre Classification**

  - Designed and trained a deep neural network (DNN) for classifying music recordings from the GTZAN dataset
  - Explored optimal batch sizes, hidden neuron configurations, and used SHAP for feature importance analysis

- **HDB Resale Price Regression**

  - Built a tabular deep learning model to predict Singapore HDB resale prices
  - Addressed feature drift and model degradation using Alibi Detect

- **Tech Stack:**
  Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Tabular, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Alibi Detect
